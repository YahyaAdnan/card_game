### Report: Organization of the Simple PHP App for Distributing Cards

#### **Overview of the Project**

This project is a simple PHP application designed to distribute cards among players in a round. Users can define the number of players, and the app manages the logic of assigning cards for each round.

#### **Folder Structure and Purpose**

The project is organized into folders and files to make it easier to manage and extend:

1. **`controller/rounds/`**

   - Contains the logic for operations related to rounds.
   - **Files**:
     - `create.php`: Handles the creation of rounds, including setting up the number of players and distributing cards.
     - `show.php`: Displays details about rounds, such as players and their assigned cards.
   - **Purpose**: Keeps the functionality for rounds separate and easy to locate.

2. **`database/`**

   - Manages database setup and connection.
   - **Files**:
     - `migrations/`: Likely contains scripts to create and update database tables.
     - `seeders/`: For populating the database with initial data (e.g., cards, test players).
     - `db_connection.php`: Establishes a database connection.
     - `setup_db.php`: Sets up the database, creating tables and initializing data.
   - **Purpose**: Organizes database-related operations for clarity.

3. **`models/`**

   - Contains representations of the main entities in the application.
   - **Files**:
     - `Card.php`: Handles properties and logic related to cards.
     - `Player.php`: Handles properties and logic related to players.
     - `Round.php`: Handles properties and logic related to rounds.
   - **Purpose**: Encapsulates data and related logic for easy maintenance.

4. **`services/`**

   - Reserved for shared functionality or utilities that can be reused.
   - **Purpose**: Centralizes reusable logic for the app.

5. **`views/`**

   - Handles the presentation layer of the app.
   - **Files**:
     - `index.php`: The main file for rendering the user interface.
   - **Purpose**: Separates visual representation from the backend logic.

6. **`vendor/`**

   - Contains dependencies managed by Composer.
   - **Purpose**: Keeps external libraries organized.

7. **Root Files**

   - `.env`: Stores environment variables such as database credentials. This file **must be configured** before running the application.
   - `composer.json` and `composer.lock`: Define and lock the PHP dependencies.
   - `autoload.php`: Handles class and dependency autoloading.
   - `Model.php`: Likely a base model class for shared logic among models.

#### **Setup Requirements**

To run the application:

1. Ensure the `.env` file is defined with the necessary database connection details, such as:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```
2. Run the database setup script by executing:
   ```bash
   php database/setup_db.php
   ```
   This step initializes the database, creating tables and adding required data.

#### **Why This Organization Works**

- **Clarity**: Each folder has a clear purpose, making the app easier to navigate and update.
- **Modularity**: Separating logic into controllers, models, and views simplifies future enhancements.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one part of the project (e.g., database, views) do not directly affect others.

#### **Extending the Project**

This organization can easily support additional features. For example:

1. **Adding Authentication**:

   - Create a `controller/auth/` folder for login and registration.
   - Add a `User` model in the `models/` folder.

2. **Supporting Multiple Games**:

   - Add a `Game` model and corresponding database migration.
   - Create a new controller folder for managing games (e.g., `controller/games/`).

3. **Improved Card Logic**:

   - Add a service in the `services/` folder for card shuffling or advanced distribution logic.

#### **Conclusion**

The current structure is simple yet practical, balancing ease of use and flexibility. While it may not be the most advanced architecture, it provides a solid foundation for small to medium-sized projects and can be expanded with minimal effort.
